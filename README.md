# Diabetes Prediction
# Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on medical and lifestyle features. Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes key health indicators to provide an early warning system for diabetes risk.
# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
# Dataset
The dataset includes features such as Pregnancies	Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin,	BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age
# Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training (Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm)
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision
# Results
The SVM model with the best kernel achieves an accuracy of 77.2%.
